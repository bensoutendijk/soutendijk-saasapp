                    <h3>About me:</h3>
                    My name is Ben Soutendijk. I am a student at The City University of New York, Hunter College. I am due to graduate Spring 2018. 
                    Throughout the process of earning my degree, I focused on building a foundation in software engineering
                    by electing to take many math and computer science courses. Utilizing my time outside of class, I have taught myself 
                    how to build and deploy web applications primarily using Ruby on Rails. However, I challenge myself constantly to learn
                    different programming languages and concepts.

                    <h3>About this website:</h3>
                    This website I made using a nice tutorial by upskillcourses.com. I found this project pleasantly engaging.
                    Ruby on Rails served as a excellent path into the world of web development. In this project I learned how 
                    to route HTTP requests to create a RESTful api, develop an application within MVC framework, and how to implement 
                    user accounts and process subscription payments with stripe.com;
